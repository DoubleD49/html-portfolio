<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I grew up around Branson Missouri where I went to the Hollister School District. After graduating from there I went to the University of Missouri and obtained my bachelors in Chemistry. Since then I've done a lot of different jobs, including managing a Waffle House, teaching high school science, and working at a health insurance comany.</p>

<p>I live with my wife, Justine, who I have been together with for 7 years. We have 4 cats together whose names are Bernie, Al, Piccolo, and Tifa. We've been living in Liberty Missouri for 4 years now.</p>

<p>In my spare time I like to read, play video games, and build model kits. I have a weekly D&D group and I've also recently gotten into Warhammer 40K. I'm also a large fan of movies, comic books, and anime.</p>
